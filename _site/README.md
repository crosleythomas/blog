### <b>[TensorFlow from Start to Finish](posts/tf_start_to_finish/introduction)</b>
A guide to the full process of developing models in TensorFlow.  I explain how to convert your data into TFRecord files, load in TFRecords, construct a model with the new Estimator API, train, and evaluate your model effectively.<br>
