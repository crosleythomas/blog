### <b>[TensorFlow from Start to Finish](posts/tf_end_to_end/tf_end_to_end)</b>
A guide to the full process of developing models in TensorFlow.  I explain how to convert your data into TFRecord files, load in TFRecords, construct a model with the new Estimator API, train, and evaluate your model effectively.

The explanations in this posts are paired with my templates for TensorFlow development.<br> [[Blog Post]](posts/tensorplates) [[Code]](https://github.com/crosleythomas/tensorplates)
